App Idea
================================================================
Web game where the user smashes fruit to get more points.

User will click lit up areas on the fruit to smash it faster, the faster you smash the more points you get
Different fruits will take longer to smash and smashing the bigger fruits faster will result in more points
(point multiplier for bigger fruits)

Routes
================================================================
Main
- Login (display buttons to login using diffrent authorizers)
- Play button(disabled until logged in)

Play
- Singleplayer (displays current highscore)
- Multiplayer with an array or different option (ranked, unranked)

Game
- this will display the game board
- if its pvp it will display both players board
- dislay the score of the current game

End Game
- this will display the end game
- show user their score for that game 
- ui for if they beat their last high score
- buttons for playing again or return to menu

Game Logic
================================================================
Random fruits appear on a board. The user will need to click lit up areas(think gridshot, aimlabs) that randomly appear on the fruit in order to smash the fruit.
The faster you smash the fruit, the more points the user will be rewarded.

smash-bonus = random areas on the fruit that when clicked will smash the fruit faster

- add fruit images
- logic for smash-bonus
- points and points multiplier for larger fruit logic
- sound effects for smashing fruit and clicking points on the fruit
- animation for smashing fruit
- drop down effect for the next fruit(tetris effect)

PvP Ideas
================================================================
- bonuses that fall from the top of board that users can click to give powerups

Powerups (possible singleplayer implementation for score bonuses)
- score multiplier for couple seconds
- bonus bigger fruit
- faster smashing(smash-bonuses appear faster)

Powerdowns for opponent
- next fruits fall slower
- if smash-bonus is missed substract points
- only drop small fruit for couple seconds

Components
- Main buttons (login, play, main menu...etc)
- Displayed score
- Game board
